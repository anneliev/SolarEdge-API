This course is an internship at a work place of our choosing. I decided to do my LIA at [Bluescreen AB](https://www.bluescreen.se/) which is a company that work with IT solutions and Web development. 
My second assignment was to produce a customized view page for the different facilitys solar energy production.

This app uses the SolarEdge API functions to get the current production overview, monthly and lifetime values for solar energy. It is displayed in Bootstrap cards and JavaScript Morris charts. The icons are from [Envato Elements](https://elements.envato.com).
